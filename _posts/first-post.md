# Live demo

Changes are automatically rendered as you type.

## Table of Contents

- Implements [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- Renders actual, "native" React DOM elements
- Allows you to escape or skip HTML (try toggling the checkboxes above)
- If you escape or skip the HTML, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used! Yay!

## HTML block below

<blockquote>
  This blockquote will change based on the HTML settings above.
</blockquote>

## How about some code?

```python
import numpy as np

def hello():
	print(test)

var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

```

Pretty neat, eh?
